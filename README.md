# End to End Encrypted Messager w. MQTT
A fun (but educational!) way to learn about asymmetric encryption and MQTT

## Prerequisites

To follow this workshop, you will need:

- A modern web browser
- Your favourite IDE
- An IBM Cloud account (which you can create [here](https://ibm.biz/Bdq8Yb))

## Introduction

In this workshop, we'll cover the basics of creating an end to end encrypted messaging application which uses MQTT to pass messages between one or more users.

To this end, we'll be creating a Node.js application which will use 

- [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) to pass messages between users through a public MQTT broker
- [Public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) to encrypt messages sent to others, and decrypt messages sent to us.
- [Express.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express.js) to deliver an application in a web browser that can send/receive messages

We won't be covering the minutiae of public-key cryptography, but by the end of this workshop we'll have an application that can send messages that should be secure up until [at least 2030](https://www.jscape.com/blog/should-i-start-using-4096-bit-rsa-keys).

## Getting started

First things first, to follow this workshop and make deploying our application to the cloud a little easier, fork this repo by clicking the 'Fork' button at the top of this repo to create your own copy that you'll be able to work from.

Once the forking process have completed, clone the repository to your local system for working on. You can do this by clicking on the "Code" button found at the top of your newly forked repo. A new dialog will appear with a URL to download the contents of your repo (it should look something like `git@github.com:<YOUR_GH_USERNAME>/end-to-end-encrypted-messaging-service.git`).

Copy that address and open the terminal application on your system and run the following command:

```
git clone <URL YOU JUST COPIED>
```

You should now have a local copy of your repository on your system that you can work on ðŸŽ‰

Enter that folder with:
```
cd end-to-end-encrypted-messaging-service
```

...and then create a new file called `.env` however you prefer to create new files.

I like `touch .env`.

Finally, now's a good time to install our application dependecies. Run `npm install` to get all of our dependencies ready when we want to run our app.

Next, open up `index.js` in your favourite IDE, this is where we'll be writing most of the code for this workshop.

## Generating Key pair

When you see the contents of `index.js` in your favourite IDE, you should see a number of dependencies and variables that we'll be using throughout the application we're about to create.

Let's take a quick look at those.

[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is a lovely little module which allows us to store environment variables for our application in a .env file when we're developing locally, but don't include to production when we deploy our application to the cloud.
```javascript
require('dotenv').config({silent : process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"});
```

Next up, we have `fs` and `crypto`. We'll be using these modules to create our pair of encryption keys and store them in our system.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const crypto = require("crypto");
```

Afterwards, we bring in the Express framework, HTTP, and some Express middleware modules that will let us stand up a very simple HTTP server that will deliver the web app that we'll send messages from.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
```

We use MQTT in this application to pass messages between users using a publicly accessible MQTT broker. Using a public broker to send messages between users may seem counterintuitive, but remember, we're using asymmetric encryption, nothing unencrypted is ever sent to the broker, so even though it's publicly accessible to anybody, nobody but the intended recipient will be able to read your messages!

All of the variables that we're assigning here and populated with values from our environment variables. Using environment variables is good practice for building applications that are scalable and transferrable. On our local system, these values will be populated with the values of a matching name from the `.env` file, but on a production system, they'll be populated by the values of the actual environment variables.

If you'd like to know more about building highly scalable/available/transferrable applications [The 12 factory app methodology](https://12factor.net/) is a must-read.

We also connect to the public MQTT broker with `mqtt.connect`. We'll be configuring the address in the next few steps.

```javascript
// Communication Libraries
const mqtt = require('mqtt');

// Configuration Variables
const privateKeyPassphrase = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE || "test";
const MQTT_BROKER_ADDR = process.env.MQTT_BROKER_ADDR;
const USERNAME = process.env.USER_NAME;
const MSGTOPIC = process.env.MESSAGE_TOPIC;

const MQTTClient = mqtt.connect(MQTT_BROKER_ADDR);
```

Finally, we set up the variables that we'll use to spin up our HTTP server, and keep track of messages and users we'll want to communicate with.

```javascript
const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);

const RECEIVED_MESSAGES = [];
const PUBLIC_USER_KEYS = {};

let publicKey;
let privateKey;
```

## Setting Local Enviroment Variables

As noted above, our application is configured with environment variables. On our local system these are stored in that lovely little `.env` file we created a little earlier.

Open up `.env` in your favourite IDE and copy and paste the following, editing where instructed:

```
USER_NAME=<REPLACE WITH THE NAME YOU WISH TO SHOW WHEN COMMUNICATING WITH OTHERS>
MESSAGE_TOPIC=ibm_developer_uk
MQTT_BROKER_ADDR=mqtt://mqtt.eclipse.org
PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE=<REPLACW WITH A REASONABLY SECURE PASSPHRASE FOR ENCRYPTING YOUR PRIVATE KEY>
```

The `USER_NAME` and `PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE` are self explanatory. 

`MESSAGE_TOPIC` is the [MQTT topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT#Overview) that we'll use to make sure everyone can find messages being sent to/from them.

`MQTT_BROKER_ADDR` is the URL that we can access the MQTT-powered message broker that will relay messages to and from each user. We'll be using the publily accessible Eclipse Foundation MQTT broker for this workshop

Once you've added that data to the `.env` file save and close it.

## Encryption keys
### Checking if we have existing keys

When our application spins up, the first thing we want it to do is check if there is already a public and private encryption key that we can use, and if so, load it up into our application. If there's no key-pair we will then generate and store those keys for use in the future.

On the line after `let privateKey` add the following chunk of code.

```javascript
if(!fs.existsSync(`${__dirname}/public.pem`) || !fs.existsSync(`${__dirname}/private.pem`)){
	console.log('Valid key pair not found. Generating new pair...');

    // Code Block 1
    

} else {
    
    // Code Block 2

    
}

// Code Block 3

```

Here, we're checking to see if there is both a `private.pem` and `public.pem` in our applications working directory. If either one is not found, we'll generate a new pair and save them to disk.

Now, I know what some of you looking at ```!fs.existsSync(`${__dirname}/public.pem`)``` might be saying:

_"You shouldn't be using synchronous operations in your application, that slows things down!"_

And you're right, that's completely true 99% of the time - but this is one of the 1% instances where I think it's totally fine:

1. Our application is starting up at this point, there's nothing it needs to be doing right now other than checking it has everything it needs to get going
2. Everything after this point in the application depends upon these operations being completed - managing the asynchronously is messy and unnecessary complex at this point in the application
3. Yes, it is slower - but we're talking **milliseconds** here, I think we can sacrifice a little bit of startup time for the savings we get in not spending 5 minutes writing pleasing, but ultimately uneeded promise chains or callbacks.

### Generating our key pair

Just below the line that reads `// Code Block 1`, copy and paste the following code:

```javascript
const keys = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('rsa', {
    modulusLength: 4096,
    namedCurve: 'secp256k1',
    publicKeyEncoding: {
        type: 'spki',
        format: 'pem'
    },
    privateKeyEncoding: {
        type: 'pkcs8',
        format: 'pem',
        cipher: 'aes-256-cbc',
        passphrase: privateKeyPassphrase
    }
});

publicKey = keys.publicKey;
privateKey = keys.privateKey;

console.log('Key pair successfully generated. Writing to disk.');

fs.writeFileSync(`${__dirname}/public.pem`, publicKey, 'utf8');
fs.writeFileSync(`${__dirname}/private.pem`, privateKey, 'utf8');

console.log('Files successfully written.');
```

The first little bit of code generates a public-key pair using the [RSA cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) with a [key size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_size) of 4096 (the largest  key that can be generated with RSA) passed through in `modulusLength`.

Long story short, bigger `modulusLength`, more secure keys we have - at least, that's the theory ðŸ˜…

For our public key we're using SPKI (pronounced _spooky_) to encode our key. For our private key we're using PKSC-8 and a 256 bit AES cipher. The main difference between these two encodings is that our PKCS-8 key can be encrypted with a passphrase.

Both keys are returned as PEM format (a base-64 encoded) certificates and assigned to the `publicKey` and `privateKey` properties of the `keys` object.

Once our keys have been generated, we assing them to our global `publicKey` and `privateKey` variables for use in the rest of our application.

Finally, we write our certificates to disk so that the next time we run our applications we can just use those instead of generating a new pair.

### Loading our keys from disk

To that end, if we already have keys we can load them and assign them to the `publicKey` and `privateKey` variables. Copy the following code and paste it just after the line that reads `// Code Block 2`:

```javascript
console.log('Existing keys found. Using those.');
publicKey = fs.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/public.pem`, 'utf8');
privateKey = fs.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/private.pem`, 'utf8');
```

## Encrypting + Decrypting Messages

### Encrypting Messages
Now that we have a public-key pair we're able to encrypt and then decrypt our own messages. Because we're going to be doing that a lot in our application, we're going to write some helpful functions that will do the job for us `encrypt` and `decrypt`.

First, let's put together the code for the `encrypt` function.

On the line immediately after `// Code Block 3` copy and paste the following:

```javascript
function encrypt(data, key){

	const buffer = Buffer.from(data);
	const encrypted = crypto.publicEncrypt(key, buffer);
	return encrypted.toString("base64");

}

// Code Block 4
```

As its name may suggest, this is our "encrypt" function. It takes two arguments `data` and `key`. The data argument is the thing that we want to encrypt, the key argument is the key that we want to use to encrypt that data. When we use this function, we'll be passing our messages that we want to send to other people as the `data` parameter, and the recipient's public key as the `key` parameter.

We first convert our string to a buffer. Any of data can be encrypted with public-key encryption, so it makes little sense for the `crypto.publicEncrypt` function to expect a string as an argument.

Once `crypto.publicEncrypt` has done it's job, it returns a buffer of encrypted data. We'll want to send this to other people through an MQTT broker in a little bit, so we'll convert it to a BASE64 string to save us having to deal with any headaches that may arise from the data being in binary form while it's being transmitted.

### Decrypting Messages

Now that we've put together a way to encrypt messages, we'll need to be able to decrypt some too.

Copy and paste the following block of code after the line that reads `// Code Block 4`.

```javascript
function decrypt(data, key){

	var buffer = Buffer.from(data, "base64");
	const decrypted = crypto.privateDecrypt({ key: key, passphrase: privateKeyPassphrase }, buffer);
	return decrypted.toString("utf8");

}

// Code Block 5
```

As you may expect, our `decrypt` function is like our `encrypt` but in reverse. Like the `encrypt` function our `decrypt` function has a `data` and `key` paramater - except this time our data is the base64 encoded string we wish to decode, and the key is our private key.

**_It's important to note that our private key can only be used to decrypt messages that have been encrypted with its matching public key._**

This time, we reconvert our base64 encoded string back to a buffer and then pass this through to `crypto.privateDecrypt` with our private key *and* the passphrase we will have set to encrypt our private key (we wouldn't want just anybody to be able to read it now, would we?).

`crypto.privateDecrypt` will take our buffer of data, decrypt it and then return a new buffer with the decrypted information. We then convert this back to a user readable string and return it as the result of the function with `return decrypted.toString('utf8');`.

If you want to test this out, you can copy and paste the following after `// Code Block 5` and then run the code with `node index.js`

```javascript
const originalString = "Hello, world.";
console.log('Original:', originalString);

const encryptedString = encrypt(originalString, publicKey);
console.log('Encrypted:', encryptedString);

const decryptedString = decrypt(encryptedString, privateKey);
console.log('Decrypted:', decryptedString);
```

And you should see something like this:

```
Original: Hello, world.
Encrypted: lBoO0thivi/kl8dBJ2UOaNQQn3KwuI..... // Truncated
Decrypted: Hello, world.
```

Remember, the only reason we can decrypt this message with our private key is _because we encrypted it with our public key_. If we were using _someone else's public key_ to encrypt the message, **we wouldn't be able to decrypt it with our private key**.

## Connecting to the Message Broker

Now that we've gotten all of our encryption/decryption logic set up, it's time to start putting together the code that will enable users to communicate with each other by an MQTT-powered messaging broker.

At the start of our `index.js` file, we have the line `const MQTTClient = mqtt.connect(MQTT_BROKER_ADDR);` which will connect our application to the MQTT broker. Once the connection has been established, we'll want to do something with that connection.

We're going to do two things

1. Subscribe to a some topics on the broker
2. Publish a message to the broker on a topic.

Copy and 

```javascript
MQTTClient.on('connect', function () {

    // Subscription 1
	MQTTClient.subscribe(`${MSGTOPIC}/message/${USERNAME}/#`, function (err) {
		if (err) {
			console.log('Failed to subscribe to:', `${MSGTOPIC}/message/${USERNAME}`);
		}
	});

    // Subscription 2
    MQTTClient.subscribe(`${MSGTOPIC}/announce/#`, function (err) {
        if (err) {
            console.log('Failed to subscribe to:', `${MSGTOPIC}/announce/#`);
		}
	});

    // C'est Moi.
	MQTTClient.publish(`${MSGTOPIC}/announce/${USERNAME}`, publicKey );

});
```

When we subscribe to a topic on an MQTT broker, we're essentially saying "I would like to know about any message sent on this topic". 

The `${MSGTOPIC}` variable is one that we set in the environment variables at the start. With it, we're essentially creating a namespace that we can call our own to listen for messages on - exactly analogous to a chat room, but with MQTT topics rather than having to manually manage connections + users.

For `Subscription 1` we're asking to have any message sent for **us specifically** to be sent on to us. The `#` is the MQTT wildcard - in our application it will be populated by the name of the person publishing the message to us on that topic.

For `Subscription 2` we're asking to have any message sent to the `/announce/` topic forwarded to us. When we spin up our application we'll publish our public key on the `/announce/<YOUR USERNAME>` topic. This will allow anybody already connected to the broker to encrypt messages to send to the person that just arrived.

Finally, with `MQTTClient.publish` we transmit our public key on the topic `/announce/<YOUR_USERNAME>` topic. This way, people will be able to encrypt messages with our public that only we'll be able to read.

## Handling messages

Now that we're subscribed to the two different topics, we want to be able to handle messages that arrive for those topics in our application.

Remember, there are two topics that we're looking for messages on:

1. `/announce` - Fired when someone new joins the broker with this application
2. `/message` - triggered whenever a message is sent for us.

Copy and paste the following code after 
```javascript
MQTTClient.on('message', function (topic, message) {

	const topicParts = topic.split('/');
	const type = topicParts[1];

    console.log('Message type:', type);
    
    // Code Block 6

});
```

Every time a message is received on one of the topics that we've subsribed to, this function will be triggered.

Now, we'll want to know how best to handle each message based on what "type" it is (that's not an MQTT concept, it's just something that we're creating for this application).

Each of the topics weve subscribed to starts with `<FAUX_NAMESPACE>/<TYPE>/<USER>`, so we can split the topic on the `/` character and deduce how best to handle the message payload based on that information.

### Exchanging public keys

Let's handle when the message arrives on the `"announce"` topic. Copy and paste the following code after `// Code Block 6`:

```javascript
if(type === 'announce'){

    const user = topicParts[2];

    if(user !== USERNAME && !PUBLIC_USER_KEYS[user]){

        PUBLIC_USER_KEYS[user] = {
            key : message.toString(),
            name : user
        };

        MQTTClient.publish(`${MSGTOPIC}/announce/${USERNAME}`, publicKey );
            
    }

} else if(type === 'message') {

    // Code Block 7

}

```

In this block of code, if we deem the message to be one that's announcing someone new is passing messages around, we first assign the variable `user` to be the value that's passed along in the (now split) topic.

Next, we want to check that the announcement of a key isn't one that we sent ourselves. Remember, when we first connect to the broker we announce our own presence too - there's no point in processing a message that we ourselves sent.

Second, we check whether or not we have a public key for this user already. If not, we'll add them to our `PUBLIC_USER_KEYS` object with their name (as derived from the topic) and their public key (recieved in the payload of the message) so that we can send encrypted messages to them.

Finally, we then also announce ourselves. For everyone who's already aware of us this will have no effect, but for the new person connected to the broker, it'll give them a chance to receive our public key so that they can send messages to us.

### Handling received messages

Now that we have the code for handling users announcing their presence, we're ready to write a little bit of code to handle receiving messages intended for us.

Copy and paste the following code after `// Code Block 7`:

```javascript
const to = topicParts[2];

if(to === USERNAME){

    const from = topic.split('/')[3];
    RECEIVED_MESSAGES.push({
        from : from,
        msg : decrypt( message.toString(), privateKey ),
        received : Number(Date.now())
    });

    console.log('Received messages:', RECEIVED_MESSAGES);

}
```

The first thing we're doing here is creating a handy variable `to` for checking who the message was intended for.

We subscribed to recieve every single message that matched our topic after `/message` so we're going to recieve other peoples messages too - but that doesn't matter - any message that has been sent by our application will only be decryptable by people with the right private key. So, while we're able to receive the encrypted messages meant for other people, we don't have the right private key to decrypt them, so all we'll get is gobbledygook.

To save us wasting time trying to decrypt messages that aren't intended for us, we'll simply check if the `to` variable is equivalent to `USERNAME` - the username we set for ourselves in the environment variables at the start of this workshop.

If the message is intended for us, then we'll split up the message topic again and get the username of the person who sent it to us. Then we'll store an object in the `RECEIVED_MESSAGES` (one of the variables that we started this application with) with the senders name, the decrypted message, and the time receive so that they can be retrieved by a viewer later.
